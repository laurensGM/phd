Adapted TRA to address user acceptance of information systems. Posits that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) directly affect behavioural intention (BI). Explains why users decide to adopt a technology. Focuses on pre-adoption or early adoption.",
    "notes": "Core constructs:\n• Perceived usefulness: a user's subjective probability that using the system will increase his or her job performance.\n• Perceived ease of use: the degree to which a user expects use of the system to be free of effort.\n• Behavioural intention\n\nLimitations: Davis did not measure subjective norms (outside influences). Initial study did not find that attitude had a significant effect on behavioural intentions.",

    "description": "Originally proposed by Richard Oliver in 1977–1980 in consumer behaviour research. Explains how post-purchase satisfaction and repurchase intentions depend on pre-purchase expectations and subsequent experience with products or services. Satisfaction is fuelled by belief disconfirmation from evaluating performance against expectations. Explains why consumers purchase again.",
    "notes": "Steps: (1) Formation of expectation — consumers form initial expectations prior to purchase. (2) Interaction and experience — they use the product and form perceptions of performance. (3) Confirmation or disconfirmation — they assess perceived performance against expectations (positive or negative). (4) Cognitive adjustment — they form a level of satisfaction. Flow: Users form expectations → experience the product → confirm (or disconfirm) expectations → this shapes satisfaction → which shapes continuance intention → which drives actual continued use.",

Confirmation is defined as congruence between expectation and actual performance; performance construct removed as its influence is captured by confirmation. Perceived usefulness from TAM was introduced to reflect post-acceptance expectations.",
